Welcome, I'm Stephen Taylor Witte, and I'm a software developer, architect, full-stack developer, back-end engineer, and sometimes scrum master. 
I build things for the web, iOS, and Android. Sometimes I work on API's, other times it is an SPA, native app, 
or micro-service. I also have a degree in music production with a minor in piano and love all types of creative endeavors.
