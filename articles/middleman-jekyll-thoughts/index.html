We use it for marketing sites and so do a lot of dev shops and agencies, but it definitely has it’s pain points. Middleman and Jekyll both came up as options. So after looking at the two I decided to write a post about the differences and similarities of each.</p><p>In regards to WordPress I found that both Middleman and Jekyll can be setup to do what WordPress does minus the CMS aspect. Since we rely on WordPress to allow product owners and non technical founders to update their content it would require a CMS like Contentful tied to a build system online to accomplish a similar thing. You still wouldn’t get the ability to preview your posts and other things would be missing as well, so for now we are still using WordPress.</p><h2>Differences & Similarities</h2><p>Both Middleman and Jekyll are static site generators, they take some template and create static html websites from them. Although that definition applies to both, Jekyll can better be described as a static blogging platform. Out of the box Jekyll provides a perfect blogging platform while Middleman requires the addition of the middleman-blog gem and some setup and configuration.</p><h3>Basic Jekyll Site Structure</h3><pre>
        <code>
          _config.yml
          _data
          _drafts
          _includes
          _layouts
          _posts
          _sass
          _site
          .jekyll-metadata
          index.html
        </code>
      </pre><p>When setting up a new Jekyll site you are given the structure of a new blog ready to customize and start posting content. The default Middleman site doesn’t give you anything but a few directories and empty files. You have to create the blog structure or the page structure and how the data is incorporated on your own. The middleman-blog extension gets you close to Jekyll out of the box but still requires more configuration. Middleman ends up being the more customizable option but for a simple blog Jekyll will have you up and running quicker.</p><h3>Basic Middleman Site Structure</h3><pre>
        <code>
          .gitignore
          Gemfile
          Gemfile.lock
          config.rb
          source/
            images
            index.html.erb
            javascripts
            layouts
            stylesheets
        </code>
      </pre><p>They both use a layout system similar to Ruby on Rails, Middleman is setup by default to use ERB templates and Jekyll is setup to use the Liquid templating system. They both have a cli for building your site and both have development servers. Both can be configured to do things like live reload and minification but I did find these things easier to configure in Middleman and the setup of Middleman made a bit more sense to me coming from Rails. Especially because Middleman uses the same asset pipeline setup and helpers as Ruby on Rails.</p><h2>Which to Choose</h2><p>After configuring your site they both operate in a very similar fashion. You add a new markdown file or update a data source and build your site. That file is compiled into a new html post and the relevant links are created, tags are updated, etc. After that you upload your site to your web server and it serves up the static html files. But I do think there are reasons to use one over the other.</p><p>If you’re looking for a simple blog with little customization and a quick setup then Jekyll is probably the better option. If you want to customize a site and have a blog in one section or more than one blog or just generate static sites from custom data sources then Middleman is probably what you’re looking for. GitHub pages use Jekyll by default but both can be hosted there. I think I would lean toward Middleman for anything other than a typical blog. I would lean toward using Middleman for any static site, the main reason being that updates to content would be so much easier in the future.</p><p>Both are well documented and the community seems very active around each one. They both have a plugin system but Middleman’s extensions seem more robust. I am going to be looking into solutions to replace WordPress in a future article and will include a more in depth look into both platforms tied to a CMS. But for now I can see Middleman replacing our current use of WordPress over Jekyll and I do think Middleman would be a quicker transition for a Rails shop.</p></article></section></div></article></main><footer class="mt-40 text-center md:ml-12 lg:ml-24 xl:ml-44 max-w-6xl pb-12 lg:pl-24 xl:pl-32 md:mr-12 pt-12 lg:mt-64 border-t border-gray-300"><aside class="absolute left-2 lg:left-12 w-1 h-1/2 -top-24 z-10 bottom-0 bg-gray-300"></aside><aside class="absolute left-8 lg:left-24 w-1 h-1/2 top-40 z-10 bottom-0 bg-gray-300"></aside><p class="font-light text-xs text-gray-400 mt-1 ml-1 px-12 text-center md:text-left max-w-4xl m-auto">Website and contents are property of Stephen Taylor Witte.
